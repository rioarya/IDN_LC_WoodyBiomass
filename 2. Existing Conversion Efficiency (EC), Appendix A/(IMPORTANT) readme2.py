This folder is dedicated to the Python script to run the existing conversion efficiency scenarios (results only shown in Appendix)

- Each python script accompanied by the corresponding Excel Files. Some parts of the script will read the data in those Excel files.
- Please check further guideline/workflow in Appendix A, Table A.22.
- The flow names in Excel files may not so intuitive. I invite the readers to check the Appendix C for a more tidy version of the 
yearly material flow tables. There, you can also find out the corresponding flow codes that can be linked with the system definition (Fig. 1)
- Some scenarios like PF_PO_EC, PF_FP_EC and DL_FP_EC has counter use material flow in separate excel files (name started with 'NonRW...')
- PF_FP and DL_FP Excel files contains the data for both improved (main manuscript) and existing conversion efficiency scenarios (Appendix).
They are the same excel files as those in 'Main Results in the Manuscript' folder and don't have the 'EC' remark in their names.
- Please replace 'C:\\my_path\\scenario_files.xlsx' with your own path/directory.
