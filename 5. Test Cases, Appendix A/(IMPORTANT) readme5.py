This folder is dedicated to the Python script to run the test case in Appendix A, section A.3.1

- Each python script accompanied by the corresponding Excel Files. Some parts of the script will read the data in Excel files.
- The 'PF_SF_test_energy' script corresponds to the test case in Fig. A.3 in Appendix A. 
- The 'PF_SF_test_energy' script will read the tab 'PF_SF_E_trial' in 'PF_SF.xlsx'.
- The 'PF_SF_test_mat' script corresponds to test cases in Fig. A.4 - A.6 in Appendix A
- The 'PF_SF_test_mat' test case script will read the tab 'PF_SF_S1_mat' in 'PF_SF.xlsx'. The users can modify the fraction of HWP that is stored
in the technosphere in column E2 in 'PF_SF_S1_mat'. Currently it shows 1, which means 100% of HWP is stored in the technosphere.
