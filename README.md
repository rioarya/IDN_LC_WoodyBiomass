# IDN - Land Conversion and Woody Biomass Utilization Scenarios

Here, we present the Python code for the following publication:

Aryapratama, R. and Pauliuk, S. Life cycle carbon emissions of different land conversion and woody biomass utilization scenarios in Indonesia. Accepted manuscript in Science of The Total Environment (doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.150226).

We categorize the Python code into five different folders:
1. Main Results in the Manuscript
2. Existing Conversion Efficiency (EC), Appendix A
3. Sensitivity Analysis, Main Manuscript
4. Sensitivity analysis, Appendix A
5. Test cases, Appendix A

Please also check the 'readme' files inside of each folder.

We also invite the readers/users to check the Appendix A of our publication, especially Table A.22 for summary of Python code workflow and its interconnection with system definition (Fig. 1 in the paper) and calculation workflow.
